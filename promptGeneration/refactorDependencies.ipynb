    "- '{managerModule}' imports several elements from '{sourceModule}'.\n",
    "-  '{problematicModule}' also accesses some elements from '{sourceModule}' directly, which is not optimal for code modularity.\n",
    "-  '{managerModule}' is in charge of managing all the responsabilities in '{problematicModule}'.\n",
    "I propose refactoring by decoupling '{problematicModule}' from its direct reliance on '{sourceModule}'. Under this approach, {managerModule} would supply the necessary state data to '{problematicModule}', if it requires it.\n",
    "I think this refactoring would allow enhance modularity and maintainability, and increase overall system flexibility and clarity.\n",
    "Does this design direction seem sound to you, or would you recommend an alternative strategy to decouple '{problematicModule}' more effectively? I'm open to suggestions on best practices, potential pitfalls, or other design patterns that you think might better serve these goals.\n",
