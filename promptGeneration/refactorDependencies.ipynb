      "- 'main.js' imports several elements from 'stateManager.js'.\n",
      "-  'guiManager.js' also accesses some elements from 'stateManager.js' directly, which is not optimal for code modularity.\n",
      "-  'main.js' is in charge of managing all the responsabilities in 'guiManager.js'.\n",
      "I propose refactoring by decoupling 'guiManager.js' from its direct reliance on 'stateManager.js'. Under this approach, main.js would supply the necessary state data to 'guiManager.js', if it requires it.\n",
